# MNS Geolocation
An Android application for comparing Android's built-in location service to Mozillas triangulation-based location services.
This app was developed in the Mobile Network Services lecture in WS 2017 at TU Wien.

## Instructions

In order to build the project it is necessary to run the task `greendao` before
you compile. This task generates the code of the DAO-layer, so compiling won't work
without it.

Apart from that, the project follows a standard Android Gradle setup.
